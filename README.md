# 🚖 Ride Booking Data Analysis Project (Power BI + SQL)

This project is an end-to-end data analytics case study based on a ride-booking dataset of over **100,000 records**, inspired by platforms like **OLA/Uber**. The goal is to extract meaningful business insights using **SQL for data exploration** and **Power BI for dashboard visualizations**.

---

## 📊 Dashboard Preview

The interactive Power BI dashboard is organized into 5 cleanly structured pages:
1. **Ride Overview** – Trends in bookings, status breakdown, and completion rates  
2. **Vehicle & Distance Insights** – Top vehicle types, ride distance analysis, and average ratings  
3. **Customer & Driver Analytics** – Top customers, ratings comparison, and behavior metrics  
4. **Cancellations & Incomplete Rides** – Reasons, rates, and pickup/drop patterns  
5. **Revenue & Payments** – Revenue trends, payment preferences, and booking value

---

## 🧠 Key Insights Uncovered

- 📈 Identified **peak ride times** and high-demand days  
- 🚗 Ranked **top-performing vehicle types** by ride distance and revenue  
- 🌟 Compared **customer vs. driver ratings** and highlighted rating patterns  
- ❌ Analyzed **cancellation trends** and **incomplete ride reasons**  
- 💰 Tracked **revenue by payment methods** and **top customers by spend**
